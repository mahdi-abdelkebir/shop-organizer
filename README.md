# shop-organizer
A tool I created because the shop I worked at, had too much products and I was simply overwhelmed and couldn't keep up.

<table cellpadding="0">
  <tr style="padding: 0">
    <!-- GitHub Stats Card -->  
    <td valign="top">
        <img src="./pictures/pic1.PNG" /> 
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
        <img src="./pictures/pic2.png"  /> 
     </td>
     <td valign="top">
        <img src="./pictures/pic3.png"  /> 
     </td>
  </tr>
</table>
